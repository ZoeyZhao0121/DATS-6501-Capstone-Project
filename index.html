                    The U.S. commercial airline industry plays a significant role in global economics and development. It is also a key element 
                    to US economic recovery after dismal pandemic years. By visualizing the key metrics and indexes from 1995 to 2020 and forecasting
                    further development, this paper attempts to overview this vital and competitive airline industry, show the fundamental elements
                    to success and identify important trends to provide insightful observations for better facing the opportunities, risks and challenges.

                 <br>
            
                    The U.S. commercial airline industry is a major component of the global economy, and will continue 
                    to grow with the demand for high-speed transportation individuals. This research aims at analyzing 
                    and comparing 3 different types of airlines based on various metrics and indexes related to revenue, 
                    expense, operation, and employment, organized by airline type, operating region or aircraft size to 
                    present an overview of individual evolution, important trends and economic loss from 1995 to 2020 as 
                    well as providing insightful observations and solid prediction for better facing the recovery  post-COVID. 
                    The project focuses on visualizing long-standing business approaches, identifying emerging trends and 
                    predicting recovery models of the ultra-low-cost carriers(ULCCs), which is an emerging airline business 
                    model in the U.S. and now represent almost 7% of all commercial departing seats, by comparing with network 
                    airline carriers and value carriers, which are extremely capital and labor intensive and have been keeping 
                    the winning streak and outpacing the economic growth over the past two decades.
